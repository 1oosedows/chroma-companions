# Chroma Companions Security Implementation Summary

## 1. Security Manager (`SecurityManager.cs`)
- **Data Encryption**: Uses AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data storage
- **Data Integrity**: Implements SHA-256 hashing to verify data hasn't been tampered with
- **Authentication**: Handles secure user authentication with server
- **Jailbreak/Root Detection**: Identifies compromised devices
- **Secure Storage**: Provides tamper-resistant methods for storing important game data
- **Tampering Detection**: Monitors for common tampering tools and techniques

## 2. Secure User Data (`SecureUserData.cs`)
- **Enhanced Validation**: Validates all data changes to prevent impossible values
- **Redundant Storage**: Maintains primary and backup data copies with integrity verification
- **Access Protection**: Uses getters/setters to control data access with validation
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Tracks and responds to potential data manipulation attempts
- **Delayed Saving**: Uses scheduled saves to improve performance while maintaining data integrity
- **Data Recovery**: Can restore from backups if tampering is detected

## 3. Anti-Tampering Protection (`AntiTamperingManager.cs`)
- **Code Integrity**: Verifies critical game code hasn't been modified
- **Memory Protection**: Protects important values from memory editors
- **Object Monitoring**: Ensures critical game objects aren't destroyed or modified
- **Time Manipulation**: Detects attempts to manipulate system time for cheating
- **Checksumming**: Uses advanced checksumming to verify game integrity
- **Protected Value Container**: Special container that validates values before they're accessed

## 4. Secure Communications (`SecureCommunicationManager.cs`)
- **SSL Certificate Pinning**: Ensures the app only connects to legitimate servers
- **Request Signing**: Cryptographically signs all API requests to prevent tampering
- **JWT Authentication**: Uses industry-standard token authentication
- **Request Throttling**: Prevents abuse through request rate limiting
- **Payload Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data sent over the network
- **Timeout Handling**: Gracefully handles network timeouts and disconnections

## Key Security Features

### Data Protection
- Complete encryption of all saved data
- Integrity verification using cryptographic hashing
- Multiple safeguards against save file manipulation
- Redundant storage with automatic recovery

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Memory protection for critical values (currency, levels, etc.)
- Time manipulation detection
- Code integrity verification
- Protected value containers that detect tampering

### Communication Security
- SSL/TLS with certificate pinning
- Request signing and verification
- Proper authentication and session management
- Protection against replay attacks

### System Design
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Graceful recovery from detected tampering
- Minimal impact on legitimate gameplay
- Configurable security levels for different environments

## Implementation Guidelines

The security system is designed to be:
1. **Modular**: Components can be used independently
2. **Configurable**: Security levels can be adjusted based on needs
3. **Unobtrusive**: Minimal impact on game performance
4. **Recoverable**: Can restore from detected tampering
5. **Comprehensive**: Protects against a wide range of threats
